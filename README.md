Use what's demonstrated in the videos to create a simple chat application

This is meant to run locally, launch the server, and do the following:

- Ask the user to input a name
- Wait for a client to connect
- Launch a client
- Ask the user to input a name
- Connect to the server
- Run a loop based on a quit condition of your liking (ie the user types in 'quit')


Any message the user enters will be sent to the host or client, depending on who is sending it


The window of the host and client will display the user name and the msg


A sample window may look like this:



> John: Hello


> Jane: Hi


> Jane: How are you?


> John: Okay



**Hint**: use a thread process packets and input concurrently
